One major function of an operating system is to allow people to work with their computers through a user interface. User interfaces can either be graphical or command line based, with graphical being the norm today. Graphical UIs allow users to intreract with their computer by clicking on icons, accessing menus and other visual images. Command line interfaces are used by typing commands, and are usually used today for dealing with more technical matters.

A second major function of an operating system is to configure devices installed to the computer. The operating system does this by using software called "drivers", which tells the operating system how to communicate with that particular device. Devices such as monitors, mice, keyboards, motherboards, graphics cards, and all external devices typically use their own device drivers.
